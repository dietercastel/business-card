# business-card
The starting point of this template is [this one](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/other/business-card) provided by [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) and originally made by [Karol Koziol](http://www.karol-koziol.net/tex/).

# QR Code and MeCard support
This template supports adding a QR Code that contains the MeCard format so adding a contact to your phone is very easy.
The specifications for the MeCard format can be found [here](https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/service/developer/make/content/barcode/function/application/addressbook/index.html). Three examples are provided two of which have a QR Code. You can reuse these very easily if you replace the contact details with your own in within the command definitions.

I included three different examples in the pdf (see above) to show the potential of the template. Below I also included images of these examples:

##Example 1
